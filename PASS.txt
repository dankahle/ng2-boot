https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-rc-update


pass:
fix these bugs for ng2.4.10, then push to repo THEN... see if you can change to ng4 and get away with it, if not, simply revert to 2.4.10 and call it a day WATCH OUT FOR ROUTING, IT'S ON 3.XX OR SOMETHING, NOTE THAT FIRST OR SAVE THE PACKAGE.JSON (BETTER).


BUG:
ng2 dropdown has a new module name (fixed), but now it's broken and hoses the chrome tab on use. Also ng dropdown toggle isn't working either. Hmmm. Did something change. You need to review ngx or not? I.e. what version of ng are you using? 2.3 right?

using ng2.4.10 now

boot is same alpha6 so unchanged
bumped ngboot to alpha22 from alpha20 see if it works now and fix what's broken

moved ng2boot to 1.6.1 and surely still broken dropdown BUT... look at code first before running again as it hangs


pass:
popover started
