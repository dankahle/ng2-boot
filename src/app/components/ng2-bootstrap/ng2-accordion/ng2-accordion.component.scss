so this is the only thing that will work here, i.e. affect all card classes inside this component. without the deep the .card class is assigned to only the host or its direct children (if you lose the :host). But this card is generated by the children so have to do this to get:
_nghost .card {} to happen, i.e. for it to assign values to the children's children. I assume none of this happens in the real shadowdom, these are just wasted skills developed to deal with emulated shadowdom
