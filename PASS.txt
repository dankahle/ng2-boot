just starting ng datepicker
looking at the ng one now

you're working on the ng datepicker, looking at that input datepicker, not sure what that is, i.e. not used in their egs. Try one out and see what it does. It's a directive right? so add to an input element and done?

 anyway check that out and get through the rest of the doc, buggy to say the least, a lot of the change month stuff gets confused when you set start date for some reason.
