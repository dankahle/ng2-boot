  <div class="title">datepicker</div>
  <div class="desc">
    ng has a multiple month view that's nice, but doesn't have anything special for "today" and no setting to display it either.
    ng2 once again has no exportAs so no way to get ahold of the datepicker in component, but no methods to call, all is controlled via Inputs. ng was clearly the easier to implement as they tied themselves together with the input, whereas ng2 I had to maintain a separate model for the input and format accordingly. Also had to place the datepicker with css whereas ng did it for you automatically. ng2 doesn't even has a input with a calendar icon example.

<div class="dk-settings" *ngIf="demo.shown">
  <span class="prop">limit to today or later</span> <input type="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="todayOrLater"><br>
  <span class="prop">start date: 12/14/1991</span> <input type="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="showStartDate"><br>
  <button class="inline btn" (click)="fireSetToday()">set today</button>
  <button *ngIf="demo.ngShow" class="inline btn btn-{{disabled ? 'danger' : 'success'}}" (click)="disabled = !disabled">
    {{ disabled ? "disabled" : "enabled"}}
  </button>
</div>

<ng-date-picker #ng="ngDatePickerComponent" *ngIf="demo.ngShow" [minDate]="minDate" [showStartDate]="showStartDate" [disabled]="disabled"></ng-date-picker>
<ng2-date-picker #ng2="ng2DatePickerComponent"  *ngIf="demo.ng2Show" [minDate]="minDate" [showStartDate]="showStartDate" ></ng2-date-picker>
