# ng2-cli

This is a demo app of the various ng-bootstrap components, plus a demo of dynamically adding a component on the fly (DkDynamicComp). Mostly nothing you can't get off the ng-boot site via their plunkers, but always helps to do it yourself and you learn by playing, this is a nicer environment to play in.
