# Ng2Boot



**ng2 and boot3**
this is the big advantage of ng2: boot3 and as such an interim solution for site conversion that won't happen all at once. To test boot3 you have to:
 * comment out the window.__theme = 'bs4'; line below
 * bower install bootstrap, which will ask you: boot 3 or 4?

so far working on boot3: (need to test rest when available)
accordion
alert
buttons
carousel
collapse
modal




**notable**
* for ng2 have to have this line to enable boot4, else ng2 wont' work right:  
&lt;script>window.__theme = 'bs4';&lt;/script>
